In order to facilitate a positive learning experience for all, I will kindly request that you adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Please do not touch each other. Not only this distracts me from delivering lectures, it also distracts your peers who are being touched. I will often say the following: **NO TOUCHY!**

1. Please only have class-related items on your desk. This implies that you may not have your wallets out, no toys and games, and materials from other courses. 

1. Liquids and iPads do not mix well, if not at all. Please have any beverages either in your bag or on the ground, i.e. not on the desk.

1. iPad usage for academic purposes all entirely encouraged. With this being said, you should not use iPad for entertainment purposes and as a distraction factor for yourself and your peers. Hence, I will kindly request that lay your iPad flat on the table and not propped up at an angle, because doing so causes others to view your screen and they can and will be easily distracted. If you must have the iPads slightly propped for ergonomical reasons, please do so in a way that it will not be distracting to your peers.

1. As the instructor of the course, I reserve the rights to speak in order to proceed with the curriculum. Please respect this and only have one person speak at a time, because it can be very loud and disturbing to hear many students speaking all at once. Furthermore, I can only speak so loudly.

1. If I must repeatedly ask you to adhere to the guidelines, I will request that we have a discussion about the classroom conduct after the course. Failure or refusal to discuss will result in an intervention by the disciplines office, i.e. you will be referred to one of the school masters to discuss the classroom behavior in a formal setting.

Once again, it is a privilege and a great honor to be the instructor of your course, and I hope that adhering to the aforementioned rules will help us maintain a pleasant learning environment. Thank you very much for your cooperation.
