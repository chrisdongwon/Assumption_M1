In order to facilitate a positive learning experience for all, I will kindly request that you adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Please do not touch each other. Not only this distracts me from delivering lectures, it also distracts your peers who are being touched. In other words,

> NO TOUCHY!

2. Please only have class-related items on your desk. This implies:
* No wallets
* No toys
* No classroom material from other courses
