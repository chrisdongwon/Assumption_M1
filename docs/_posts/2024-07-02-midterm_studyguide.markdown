1. Let $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ (i.e. $$n$$ is an element of the set of natural numbers, hence $$n$$ is any positive whole number starting with 0). What does it mean for $$n$$ to be a prime? What does it mean for $$n$$ to be a composite? What if $$n = 0$$? What if $$n = 1$$? Hint: do you remember the **definition** of prime numbers and composite numbers? Sometimes, a number is neither prime nor composite...
